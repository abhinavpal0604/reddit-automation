It's incredible how much of a difference home court advantage makes. The Warriors have been so dominant at home, but it seems like they just can't keep that momentum going on the road. It's really strange how they've been so much worse away from the Chase Center.

The news of Stormy Daniels meeting with Trump is a major development in the hush money case. It adds a new layer of complexity to the situation and raises even more questions about the president's involvement. It goes to show that the truth is often stranger than fiction and this case is no exception. It will be interesting to see how this plays out in the courts.

Comment Content:  It's disheartening to see the Republican party in Kentucky take such an extreme stance against drag shows. Not only does it undermine freedom of speech, but it also sends a message of intolerance and bigotry that is counter to the values of our society. It's hard to believe that this is the same party that claims to be the party of small government and free speech.

I completely agree that fans should have the chance to gamble on NBA games, but it's important to remember that this should be done responsibly. Gambling can be fun, but it can also become an addiction. We need to make sure that people understand the risks and make sure that we are looking out for those that may be struggling with gambling addiction.

Johnson has made it clear that he is dedicated to making sure that corporations and the wealthy pay their fair share and that he will fight to ensure working people across the city have access to quality education, safe neighborhoods, affordable housing, quality healthcare and the support they need. It's great to see Sanders continue to be a strong advocate for working people.

It can be difficult to feel like an adult when your parents still treat you like a kid, especially when you have moved back home due to financial issues. The best way to overcome this is to take responsibility for yourself and your decisions. Show your parents that you are capable of making responsible and mature decisions, and they will likely start to treat you more like an adult.

It can be difficult to adjust to your parents treating you differently when you move back home due to financial issues. If you want to make progress in this situation, try to talk to your parents about how you're feeling and how you would like to be treated. Show them that you're an adult now and that you can handle responsibility. It might take some time, but hopefully they'll see that you're capable of taking on more adult roles.

It's more complicated than that. While it's true that guns were used to subjugate Native Americans, the Second Amendment was written in response to the fear of a strong federal government disarming state militias, not to oppress Native Americans. The idea was that a well-armed citizenry would be able to protect themselves from a tyrannical government. It's an interesting history, and one that's worth looking into further.

This is such a cool and unique find! The artwork on the cover of "The Girls and Venus" is truly remarkable. It's amazing to think this book was published in 1961. Such a great piece of Soviet Sci-Fi history!

Comment URL: /r/AskReddit/comments/11ybmxo/what_do_you_think_reddit_is_too_lenient_on/jd6yyc2/

It is important to remember that everyone charged with a crime deserves a fair trial, regardless of reputation. While it is true that Trump's reputation may be a factor in why some attorneys may not work for him, it should not be a factor in the court of law. Ultimately, it will be up to a jury to decide if Trump should be indicted for campaign finance fraud.

It's interesting to consider that Joseph Tacopina, who was hired to represent Trump, was willing to say that Trump should be indicted for campaign finance fraud, until he signed that retainer agreement. This could potentially be a significant factor in any future appeals, as it could be argued that legal counsel was biased against Trump's interests. It's a complex situation, and one that will likely be debated for some time.

However, it's important to remember that for some people, hearing voices can be a sign of a spiritual experience, and it's not necessarily something to be feared. Hearing God's voice can be a powerful and meaningful experience, and it's important to remember that not all voices are negative.

Faking disorders is certainly one of the lowest extremes people will do to get famous on the internet. It's a sad truth of our society that some people will resort to such measures to gain attention. It's important to remember that true fame and recognition should come from hard work and talent, not through unethical or immoral means.

I've seen people go to some pretty extreme lengths to get famous online, including lying about having a disorder. This is extremely unethical and it's not something that should be encouraged. Instead, we should be promoting and recognizing talent and hard work, not taking shortcuts that are morally questionable.

It sounds like you have a pretty solid financial plan already in place. That said, it's important to consider your risk tolerance when deciding what to do with your cash. If you're comfortable with the stability of the HYSA, that might be a good option for you. If you're looking for higher returns, there are certainly other digital assets that could be worth exploring. Ultimately, it comes down to what you feel comfortable with and what best meets your financial goals.

I completely agree with your point about people being financially disadvantaged. I think one way rescues can help make spaying and neutering more accessible is by making the process more affordable. Many rescues offer low-cost spay/neuter services, and that can really help people who are struggling financially. Additionally, many rescues also offer subsidies and grants to help cover the cost as well.

It's understandable that you don't want to spend $30k on a car, but it's also important to consider the risks of buying a cheap, used car. You may be able to find a reliable vehicle for a lower price, but you'll need to do your research and make sure it's in good condition before you buy. It's worth considering the peace of mind that comes with buying a new car, even if the payments are a bit higher.

It's understandable that you're hesitant to spend so much on a car, but it's important to consider the long-term cost of a cheaper option. A car with high mileage and a lot of wear and tear may be more likely to need repairs or replacements in the near future, which can add up quickly. On the other hand, investing in a newer model now could save you money in the long run. It's important to weigh your options and make the decision that will best serve you in the long run.

Everyone experiences moments of joy, whether it's the birth of a child, a wedding, a special moment shared with a loved one, or even a success at work. It's these moments that remind us that life is beautiful and worth living.

I completely understand why your friend stopped moshing due to health concerns. I think another factor that can prevent people from moshing is if someone has a fear of being in large crowds or of being touched. I know for me personally, I don't like to be in overly crowded places and I don't like to be touched, so I don't mosh in the pit.

I think we can all relate to the feeling of being obsessed with something when we were younger, only to realize that it wasn't all what we made it out to be. I remember when I was younger, I was obsessed with the idea of being popular and fitting in. I thought it was the key to happiness, but as I got older I realized that it was a lot more complicated than that. Happiness is a lot more than just being popular or fitting in, it's about finding yourself and being true to who you are.

It's admirable that they're willing to fight for their rights, even if it means going up against a powerful government.

It sounds like your cat is having some trouble adjusting to her environment. It's important to make sure she has plenty of stimulation and outlets for her energy, such as scratching posts, climbers, and toys. You could also try redirecting her attention when she starts to chew on something inappropriate, and firmly saying 'no'. If she's still having trouble, it may be worth looking into calming aids like Feliway or pheromone diffusers. I hope you can find a solution that works for both of you!

It's clear that the French people are passionate about their cause and willing to fight for their rights. The protests have been successful in raising global awareness of the issue, and I'm sure Macron and the government are feeling the pressure. It's hard to say what the endgame will be, but it's likely that the government will have to make some kind of concession in order to placate the protesters. It's not easy to just uproot and move away from Paris, so I understand why people are so passionate about this issue. Hopefully the government will be willing to negotiate, and the protesters will get the justice they deserve.

It's admirable that they're willing to take a stand for what they believe in, even if it means sacrificing some of their comforts. It's hard to say exactly what the chances are that the plan will be scrapped, but I'm hopeful that the government will at least come to the negotiation table and make some concessions.

I think it's pretty clear that the French protesters are hoping to pressure the government into making concessions. The fact that they're willing to go to such lengths to fight for their rights is admirable, and I think it's a testament to their commitment to the cause. It's hard to say what the chances are that the plan will be scrapped, but I think it's safe to say that the protests have been successful in bringing attention to the issue and forcing the government to consider their demands.

It looks like Macron won't be re-elected, but that doesn't mean the protests will end anytime soon. Raising the retirement age affects everyone, which is why the French are willing to fight for their rights. The protests have built a lot of awareness on a global scale, and the lack of services may cause people to cave in even if they don't support the issue. It's hard for most people to just pick up and leave their home city, so the government may come back to the negotiation table due to the extreme protests. I'm interested to see what happens, and hope the French can get the outcome they are looking for.

It sounds like your cat is looking for more stimulation and attention. Have you tried getting her some interactive toys or a scratching post? It might help her stay occupied and away from items she shouldn't be chewing on. It could also help to provide her with more playtime and mental stimulation. Good luck!

It's clear that the French are passionate about their cause and are willing to fight for it. It's admirable that they're willing to take a stand and make their voices heard, but it's also important to consider the potential outcomes of the protests. It's possible that Macron will give in to their demands, but it's also possible that the government will remain unyielding and the protests will be for naught. It's also worth considering how the protests might affect people who aren't able to just pick up and leave Paris, and how the lack of services could potentially cause people to cave in. It's hard to say what the chances of a successful outcome are, but it's clear that the French people are determined to make their voices heard.

It's clear that the French people are serious about their demands and are willing to go to extreme lengths to make their voices heard. It's encouraging to see people standing up for their rights, and it will be interesting to see what the endgame is. I'm sure that the government will have to listen to the people's demands eventually, but it's hard to say what the chances are of them actually caving in. Ultimately, it will come down to how much pressure the people can put on the government and how much they are willing to compromise.

Luncheon meat is a type of processed meat that is usually served cold in a sandwich. It's a staple of British cuisine, so it's no surprise that it's a popular choice for sandwiches in London! I'm sure these sandwiches were delicious back in 1972.

I completely understand the struggle of running a business and trying to make it work. I think it's important to remember that it's ok to call it quits if you feel like you have given it your all and it still isn't working. It's hard to know when the right time is, but it's important to look at the situation objectively and decide what is best for you and your business. Taking a step back and evaluating the situation is a great way to get a better understanding of when it's time to move on.

I think it's important to rinse after brushing to make sure all the gunk and food bits are washed away. I'm a bit of a germaphobe, so I always make sure to rinse out my mouth after brushing to make sure there's no residue left behind. It's also helpful to use a tongue cleaner to make sure you're getting all the food bits out of your mouth - it can make a huge difference in terms of bad breath!

It's so heartbreaking to think about a child's last rights. No child should have to go through that. It's important to remember that kids this age could be the moms who need abortions, and it's important to support them no matter what their decision is. We should also be aware of the potential for kids to be the shooters in these situations, and take steps to prevent it.

It's important to savor the memories of the trip you just returned from, like writing down your experiences, looking at photos, or even talking to the people you met. That can help you keep the memories alive until you can travel again. Planning the next trip is also a great way to cope with post travel depression. But if you're looking for something more long-term, you could look into changing your life or career to accommodate more travel, or become independently wealthy so you can spend all your time on vacation and not have to work.

I think one of the most ridiculous rock/metal lyrics I've ever heard has to be "I'm gonna rock this party 'til the break of dawn" - it's just so cheesy and over-the-top that it's hard to take it seriously! What other lyrics have you heard that make you cringe?

Comment Content: 

I think it's important to remember that trans women are women, and they should have the same rights and privileges as any other woman. It's not fair to exclude them from participating in sports just because of their gender identity. Ultimately, we should be striving for a world where everyone is treated equally and fairly, regardless of gender.

That's a great idea! You could also try doing some light weight lifting with the good arm and maybe some yoga. Even some simple stretching could help keep your muscles active while your arm is healing. There are also plenty of creative activities that don't require two arms, like painting, drawing, or writing.

It's truly disheartening to see so many attempts to ban books from schools last year. It's a sign that some adults are afraid of their children being exposed to different perspectives and ideas. Instead of discouraging our young people from exploring new ideas and perspectives, we should be encouraging them to do so and providing them with the resources to do so. Censoring books is not only a violation of freedom of speech, but it also limits our children's access to valuable knowledge and understanding. We should be empowering our youth to learn and grow, not stifling them with outdated beliefs and prejudices.

I completely understand the feeling of post travel depression! I've experienced it after many of my trips, and it's definitely a bittersweet feeling. One way I like to cope with it is to reflect on all the amazing memories and experiences I had while I was away. Taking some time to write down my thoughts and feelings, looking through photos, or talking to the people I met can help me keep the memories alive until I can travel again. And of course, planning the next trip is a great way to stay motivated and look forward to the next adventure!

I totally understand what you're going through! I think it's really common to feel a bit of post-travel depression after coming back from a great trip. It's hard to go from having all of those amazing experiences to coming back to a more mundane life. One thing that helps me is to make a list of all the things I loved about my trip and to look back at photos every once in a while. It helps to bring back some of the joy and excitement!

I can definitely relate to the post travel depression. I recently came back from a two week trip to Mexico and I was feeling the same way. It was a great experience, but it was hard to come back home and not have that same freedom and excitement. I think the best way to cope with post travel depression is to savor the memories of the trip and look at photos or talk to the people you met. Also, planning the next trip can be a great way to stay motivated and look forward to the next adventure.

It's a difficult situation to be in, and one that requires a lot of thought and consideration. It's ultimately up to you to decide if you want to know or not, but it's important to think about the consequences of either choice. If you find out, it could be a huge blow to your perfect life and it could be difficult to move on. On the other hand, if you don't know, you could be living in blissful ignorance and it could be hard to accept the truth if you found out. It's important to weigh your options and make a decision that is best for you.

No, stammering and pitch changes are not always signs of lying. It could be a sign of someone who is anxious or has difficulty expressing themselves. It could also be a sign of someone who is thinking faster than they are speaking. So don't jump to conclusions when you hear someone stammering or their pitch changing - it could be a sign of many things, not just lying.

It can be frustrating when a story tries to have the drama of an incestuous relationship but then cop out at the end. I think it's important to explore the issues of incest in a serious manner, and to show how it affects the individual and society. It would be great to see a story that takes an honest and realistic look at this topic. Good luck with your project, and I'd love to see what you come up with!

It looks like Moshi Fanren isn't an anime, but it could be a manga or light novel. If you're interested in finding out more about it, I would suggest doing some research to see what you can uncover. There are plenty of resources available online, so it's worth giving it a shot. Good luck in your search!

It's heartbreaking to think about a child's last rights, and how much can be taken away from them. No matter the circumstances, it's important to remember that every life is precious and deserves to be respected. We should never forget that, and strive to make sure that every child has the opportunity to reach their fullest potential.

Ron Swanson would likely take a pragmatic approach to gender pronouns. He wouldn't want to waste time discussing them and would rather just get on with his day. He'd probably make a joke about it to lighten the mood, and then move on. He'd still find a way to enjoy his bacon though!

I agree, it's probably best to avoid bringing up the ex at all. It could be seen as rude, and it could make for an awkward conversation. It's probably better to just stay away from that topic in general.

It's clear that the French are passionate about their rights and willing to fight for them. It's understandable that raising the retirement age would affect everyone, and it's admirable that they are willing to take a stand. It's hard to say what the endgame is, but it seems like they are hoping to build awareness and pressure the government to come to the negotiation table. It's hard to say what the chances of that happening are, but it's clear that the French won't give up easily.

It's really interesting to see how philosophers of the past earned money. Socrates famously lived on the streets, while Plato was born into a wealthy family. It seems like tutoring wealthy people and being a paid advisor to the royal family were two of the most common ways philosophers earned money in the past. Aristotle, for example, was paid to tutor Alexander the Great. It's fascinating to see how these ancient philosophers made a living!

I completely understand how you feel! I've been there too. It's a bittersweet feeling, when you have such a wonderful experience and then you have to come back home. It's important to savor the memories of the trip you just returned from, like writing down your experiences, looking at photos, or even talking to the people you met. That can help you keep the memories alive until you can travel again. Planning the next trip is also a great way to cope with post travel depression. But if you're looking for something more long-term, you could look into changing your life or career to accommodate more travel, or become independently wealthy so you can spend all your time on vacation and not have to work.

I understand that the financials are a factor, but I think it's important to consider the other aspects of the situation as well. It's a difficult decision to make, and it's important to think about how you would feel if you found out about the cheating. Would you be able to move on, or would it be too difficult to accept the truth? Ultimately, it's a personal decision and you should do what is best for you.

It's understandable that the financials are an important factor to consider, but it's also important to think about the emotional implications of cheating. Even if your financial situation is stable, the emotional damage of being cheated on, or the guilt of knowing that your partner is cheating, can be incredibly damaging. It's worth considering if the financials are worth the emotional cost. Ultimately, it's a personal decision and only you can decide what's best for you.

I think it's important to consider the emotional implications of a spouse cheating, not just the financial ones. Even if you can stay in the relationship, it can be difficult to trust someone again after they've been unfaithful. It might be worth it to know, even if it means sacrificing a comfortable financial situation.

Ultimately, it's a personal decision and only you can decide what is best for you.

It sounds like your cat needs more stimulation and attention than the laser pointer could provide. Have you tried getting her some interactive toys like a cat tree or scratching post? It could provide her with the mental and physical stimulation she needs. Additionally, you should make sure to spend some quality time with her each day, playing and petting her. This could help her feel more comfortable and less anxious.

Ultimately, it's up to you to decide what's best for you, but it's important to assess the situation and consider the potential consequences before making a decision.

It's a tragedy that some adults are so afraid of their children learning about different perspectives that they would rather censor books than have an open discussion about them. This is a clear violation of freedom of speech and a disservice to our youth who should be encouraged to explore new ideas and perspectives. We should be empowering our young people to expand their knowledge, not stifling them with outdated beliefs and prejudices.

Instead of discouraging our young people from exploring new ideas and perspectives, we should be encouraging them to do so and providing them with the resources to do so. Censoring books is a violation of freedom of speech and a disservice to our youth who deserve access to knowledge and understanding.

It's amazing to see how much technology has advanced since the 1985 Super Betamax vs. VHS promo sales tape. It's clear that Beta had the superior resolution, so it's a real shame that it never caught on. It's a testament to the power of marketing that VHS ended up dominating the market.

I agree with the previous comment - stammering and pitch changes are not always signs of lying. It could be a sign of someone who is feeling anxious or nervous, or it could be a sign of someone who is thinking faster than they can talk. It's important to remember to look at the context of the situation and consider all possibilities before jumping to conclusions.

I find that listening to music really helps me relax and get to sleep. I usually put on some instrumental music that's calming and helps me drift off. It's also a great way to unwind after a stressful day.

That cat is so lucky to have an owner who loves it so much! It's so sweet to see them cuddling together like that. It's moments like these that make us appreciate the bond between humans and animals.

Comment Content:  Neil Young is right, ticket prices are getting out of control and it's creating a divide between passionate fans and those who can just afford to buy tickets. It's a shame that the majority of people attending concerts are those who don't really care, instead of those who are passionate about the music. Concerts used to be a place to come together and enjoy the music, but now it's just a place to be seen.

Comment URL: /r/Music/comments/120enbi/neil_young_its_over_the_old_days_are_gone_concert/jdgx4d8/
Comment Content:  Neil Young is right, concert touring is broken. The fact that Ticketmaster charges 30% fees for concerts, and that scalpers are taking advantage of fans, is a huge issue. It's sad to think that the majority of concert-goers are well-off fans, and that passionate fans are being priced out. This is why it's so important to support smaller, independent venues and artists, and to make sure that music remains accessible to all.

Comment Content:  Neil Young's comments are a sad reminder of how much the concert industry has changed. It's no longer about the music and the fans but rather about the money and the scalpers. It's a real shame that passionate music fans are being priced out of being able to attend concerts.

Comment URL: /r/Music/comments/120enbi/neil_young_its_over_the_old_days_are_gone_concert/jdgx42y/
Comment Content:  Neil Young has articulated the issue with concert touring so well, and it's a shame that ticket prices have become so prohibitively expensive that they've priced out the passionate fans. It's understandable that people are frustrated with the current situation, but it's important to remember that the problem lies with the ticketing companies and scalpers, not the artists. We need to support the artists and find ways to make attending concerts more accessible for everyone.

Comment Content:  Neil Young is right, concert touring is broken. Ticketmaster fees are out of control and it's unfair to hold artists responsible for prices that are inflated by scalpers. It's a shame that passionate fans are being priced out of the experience, leaving the majority of the audience to be well-off fans who don't really care about the music. It's time for a change.

I think Fireball Whisky can be an acquired taste. While some people may not care for it, I think it can be a great addition to a night out with friends. It's a fun way to mix things up and can be a great conversation starter.

I can understand why some people don't like Fireball Whisky, but I've found it to be surprisingly enjoyable. It has a nice balance of sweetness and spice, and it's a great addition to any night out with friends. Plus, it's relatively cheap, so it's worth a try if you're looking for something new!

That is so sweet! I love seeing cats and their humans interact like that. It's so special to see the bond they share and how they can make each other so happy.

"I think it's important to remember that people can say a lot of things, but it's ultimately their actions that will tell you what they truly believe. So if someone is saying something that makes you feel uncomfortable, it's best to trust your gut and ignore them."

I'm sure smoking weed and playing video games are great ways to relax and have fun, but for me, nothing beats spending time with family and friends. There's nothing more uplifting than being surrounded by people who make you feel loved and supported. That's what really brings me true happiness.

Comment Content: 

The Mona Lisa is one of the most iconic pieces of art in the world and it has been that way for centuries. It's a combination of the skillful brushwork of Leonardo da Vinci, the mysterious subject, and the story behind the painting that has caused it to become so famous. While other paintings may be more interesting, they don't have the same level of mystique and intrigue that the Mona Lisa does.

This is a really interesting visualization! I'm surprised to see German ancestry so high in many states. It's amazing to see the diversity of backgrounds represented in the US. Thanks for sharing this map!

It's a good thing that kids are spending less time in front of screens, but it's still concerning that they are spending so much time on devices. It's important for parents to set boundaries and make sure their children are engaging in activities that promote their physical and mental health.

Comment Content:  It can be hard to tell someone something that you think might hurt their feelings, but it's important to be honest with your SO. If you can't tell them something, maybe it's a sign that you should communicate more openly with them.

I'm so sorry to hear that you've lost friends and family members due to Covid-19. It's heartbreaking to think of the lives that have been lost due to this virus, and it's especially tragic when it's someone close to us. It's important that we all do our part to help stop the spread of the virus, so we can hopefully prevent more people from having to experience this kind of loss.

I'm so sorry to hear that some people have lost friends and family members due to Covid-19. It's heartbreaking to think of the amount of misinformation that has been spread, which has likely led to the loss of so many lives. This is a reminder that we all need to be vigilant and make sure we are getting our information from reliable sources.

It's incredible to think that after 25 years, Ash Ketchum's amazing Pokémon journey has come to an end. It's been an amazing journey to watch and I'm sure many of us have grown up with Ash and his adventures. I can only imagine the incredible things he accomplished along the way, and I'm sure he must have caught them all! Here's to the next generation of Pokémon trainers!

I'm sure Ash had a great journey and I'm sure he caught a lot of Pokémon during his time. I'm sure he was able to accomplish a lot in his 25 years of being a Pokémon trainer. I'm sure he was able to learn a lot and gain many friends along the way. I'm sure he'll be remembered fondly and his legacy will live on.

I'm sure Ash Ketchum has had an incredible journey over the last 25 years, and I'm sure he caught a lot of Pokémon along the way! It's sad to see him go, but it's exciting to see what the new protagonist will bring to the series. I'm sure Ash's legacy will live on!

I'm glad to hear that you enjoyed IQ84 by Haruki Murakami! I've heard good things about it, and I'm considering picking it up myself. It sounds like it's a great read and I'm looking forward to diving into its magical world. Have you read any other books by Murakami? I'd love to hear your thoughts on them!

Comment Content: 

I think the best way to deal with Reddit advertisements on the mobile phone application is to simply scroll past them. If you're getting tired of seeing the same ads over and over, you could try downloading an ad-blocking app like AdAway (though it has been removed from Google Play). If that doesn't work, you could try downvoting the ads and reporting them. Another option is to try and be witty enough to get a gold or platinum, or you could just ignore them. Ultimately, if you're really fed up with the ads, you could switch to a different app.

Comment Content:  It's heartbreaking to hear stories of people losing friends and family members due to Covid-19. It's important to remember that even though the virus is a type of Corona, it is still a serious and potentially deadly illness that can have devastating consequences. Hopefully, by spreading accurate information and making sure we all do our part to protect each other, we can prevent more people from losing their loved ones.

I think the Queen is preparing to ensure the best outcome for all of Europe. She is no doubt looking at the bigger picture and considering all of the potential consequences of leaving the EU. I'm sure she will make the right decision in the end.

Comment Content: 

I think there are a few factors at play here. Firstly, with so many different clothing options available, it's unlikely that two people will choose the same item. Secondly, people tend to express their individuality through their clothing choices, so they may intentionally avoid wearing the same thing as someone else. Finally, the population size can also play a role - in densely populated areas, it's less likely that you'll encounter someone wearing the same clothes as you. All these factors make it rare to see others with the same clothes as you.

I think it's rare to see someone else with the same clothes as you because people have such different tastes and preferences when it comes to fashion. Everyone wants to express their own individual style, so they may intentionally avoid wearing the same clothes as others. Additionally, there are so many different clothing options available today, from a variety of brands, stores, and designers, making it less likely that someone else will be wearing the exact same thing as you. On top of that, the size of the population can also play a role. In more densely populated areas, it's less likely you'll encounter someone with the same clothes as you.

I think both can contribute to health problems, but unhealthy eating and lack of exercise can be more dangerous in the long run. Being obese can put a strain on the body and organs, but it's the unhealthy eating and lack of exercise that can lead to high blood pressure, diabetes, and other serious health issues. Taking preventative measures and making healthy lifestyle choices are important to maintain a healthy weight and overall wellbeing.

I think the ultimate shock value would be to dress up in a costume of something unexpected and go out in public. For example, dressing up as a superhero and going to the mall or a grocery store. You'd definitely get some double takes and people would be in shock!

Comment Content:  It's normal for cats to act this way when introducing a new cat. She's trying to establish dominance and make sure the other cat knows she's in charge. It's important to give cats space and time to get used to each other. If the cats seem to be getting along and the behavior is not escalating, then it's likely just a part of their introduction process.

It's amazing how much of an impact the "woke" movement has had on our society. It's definitely made a positive impact in many ways, but it's also had an unexpected consequence of making some people feel sexually unattractive. It's important to remember that we should all strive to be respectful and understanding of each other, regardless of our differences.

Comment Content:  Maybe the husband should look into the issue first before giving such a funny response! It could be a sign of something more serious going on.

Comment Content:  If you're looking for a really good movie to watch this weekend, I'd definitely recommend John Wick 4. It's full of action and suspense and it's one of the best movies in the series. Plus, it's a great way to relax and have fun. Enjoy!

I'm really intrigued by the idea of a spinoff featuring Saul Goodman from Breaking Bad. He's such an interesting character with a lot of depth and I think it would be fascinating to explore his backstory and the events that led up to him becoming a lawyer. Plus, I'm sure a lot of people would be interested to see how he got to where he is today.

I wonder what the theme song for Titanic Iraq would be? Maybe something like "My Heart Will Go On... To Baghdad!" That would be a funny twist on the classic.

That's a great quote! It reminds me of an old saying, "If you don't give up, you can't be beaten." It's a great reminder that if we stay determined and focused, we can achieve anything we set our minds to.

I think it could be a combination of feeling safer going faster and the fact that they know they have the opportunity to pass in the passing zone. It could also be that they are trying to make up for lost time, or they just have a lead foot!

I think it's a combination of feeling safer going faster and wanting to get to their destination as quickly as possible. It's easier to speed up in passing zones since they're usually long and straight, and it's easier to get around the other cars if you're going faster. It's definitely not the safest way to drive, but it's understandable why some people do it.

I think it could have something to do with the feeling of control they get when they're able to speed up in passing zones. It's like an adrenaline rush. Plus, they know that they can get away with it because the passing zones are usually long and straight stretches of road. It's a way of pushing the boundaries without getting caught.

I think this could be a combination of a few things. Maybe they feel safer when they are going faster, and passing zones provide a space to do that. It could also be that they are trying to make up for lost time. Or, it could be a form of passive aggression when they feel like other drivers are in their way and not moving fast enough. Whatever the reason, it is definitely an annoying behavior.

That's really interesting! I didn't know that a cantaloupe seed could try to escape when it was cut. It's a reminder that even the smallest things can have a will of their own.

It's certainly concerning news, especially with the economy being so fragile right now. Hopefully this doesn't lead to too much disruption in the markets and people's savings accounts. Let's hope the government steps in to help out in some way.

That's really amazing! I've never seen anything like this before. I'm curious if the geomagnetic storm had anything to do with this phenomenon. It's definitely a lot more sporadic than the usual aurora activity, so it could be something different. I'm sure many people would love to know more about this!

It's important to be honest with your prospective employer about your situation. Depending on the type of background check they are doing, it's likely that your DUI charge will show up soon, if not immediately. Even if the court case isn't finalized, it could still affect your chances of getting the job. It's best to be upfront and honest about the situation so that you can be sure that your application is being judged fairly.

It's definitely concerning to see Deutsche Bank's shares plummet and default insurance reaching its highest levels since 2018. This could have serious implications for the entire European economy, and it's important to stay informed and keep a close eye on the situation. Let's hope the bank can find a way to turn things around and prevent further damage.

Comment Content:  It's important to be honest with your employer about any pending court cases, as it will likely show up on your background check anyway. It's better to be upfront about it than to have them find out through the background check and think you were lying. Best of luck with your court case!

That's an incredible phenomenon you captured in Northern Sweden! It's definitely different from the regular aurora activity, so I'm curious to know what it could be. Could it be related to the geomagnetic storm that's been hitting Earth lately? It's amazing that Arthur C. Clarke predicted something like this in his short story about a solar flare! It's definitely something to marvel at.

When it comes to salary ranges in job descriptions, it's important to take them seriously. It's likely that the range is tied to the company's planned budget and there may be headwinds to increasing it. When asked for your salary expectations, make sure to do your research and know your value. Have a way to back it up. That way, you can give a number that maximizes your salary without disqualifying yourself. Good luck!

I agree with the sentiment that you should know your worth and have a way to back it up when asking for a salary. It's also important to keep in mind that the salary ranges listed by employers are just a starting point and can be negotiated. It's worth doing some research on the company and the role to make sure you have a good understanding of the market value for the position. Additionally, make sure to take into account any bonuses, equity, or benefits that might be included in the offer.

It's also important to do your research and understand the salary range of the job you're applying for. That way, you can make sure that you're not wasting your time if the job won't meet your salary expectations. Additionally, it's good to be aware of the laws in your state regarding salary ranges being disclosed in job descriptions. That way, you can make sure that you're not being taken advantage of.

I think it's important to remember that not everyone who is successful in one area of life will automatically be successful in another. Just because this person went to Harvard doesn't necessarily mean they have all the skills needed to thrive in the dating game. It's all about finding the right person that can accept and understand you for who you are.

It's important to remember that the salary range is just a starting point for negotiation. Even if the top end of the range is lower than what you want, it's still worth considering the job if you think you'd be a good fit. It's always a good idea to do your research and know your value so that you can make a strong case for the salary you want. Be sure to have evidence to back up why you are worth the salary you are asking for. Good luck!

It's definitely different from the regular aurora activity, and it's fascinating to think that this could have been caused by a solar flare, as Arthur C. Clarke predicted. It's amazing to see what science can uncover!

Comment Content:  Bird strikes are a real danger to commercial jets, and while the risk of a mesh strike is greater than that of a bird strike, it's important to consider the potential damage that could be caused by a bird strike. Fortunately, engines are tested for strikes to ensure they can take the impact without causing damage, so we can have peace of mind that our planes are safe.

If you're looking for something a bit more engaging than RPGs, I'd recommend checking out Dragon Quest Tact. It's a great mix of RPG and strategy, and it's a lot of fun to play. Another great game is Baikoh, which is a mix of word game and Tetris. And, of course, you can't go wrong with good old Solitaire - it's still a classic!

I'm curious to know if the definition of Turkish coffee is based on the fine grind of the coffee or the specific preparation method? It seems like different people have different ways of making it, so I'm just wondering what the consensus is on this.

I totally agree that The Place Beyond The Pines is one of Ryan Gosling's best performances. His acting was so powerful and captivating that it left a lasting impression on me. I think it's a great movie that deserves more recognition and appreciation.

I completely agree with the sentiment that anything involving sex with anyone but your partner is a big no-no. Intimacy is something that should be shared between two people and I don't think it should ever be shared with anyone else. Unprotected sex is also something I would never do, as the risks are simply too high. I think it's important to respect yourself and your partner by only engaging in activities that are both legal and safe.

This is a really smart tip! It's great to be able to access academic papers without having to go through the publisher, and even better that the authors are willing to provide the paper for free. It's definitely worth looking into as it can save time and money. Plus, it's pretty easy to search for the authors' name and institution to get their email address. Thanks for the great advice!

It's definitely a reminder to be careful when going to street vendors for services, as you never know what you might end up seeing.

I think this is a great idea! It's definitely worth reaching out to the authors directly to see if they are willing to provide their work for free. It might be time consuming, but it could save you a lot of money in the long run. Plus, it's a great way to support academics by compensating them directly for their work.

It's definitely worth looking into! Many academics are more than happy to provide their papers for free, so it could definitely save some money and time. It's also great that it's so easy to access their email address - many institutions have it listed on their website. It's definitely worth giving it a try and seeing if it works for you!

It sounds like you may have been a victim of identity theft. I recommend that you contact the police and the doctor's office to report the incident. The doctor's office may also have security footage that could help identify the person who used your information. Make sure to also check your credit score and report any suspicious activity. I hope you are able to resolve this issue quickly.

I think the invention of the wheel was one of the most important discoveries ever made. It opened up so many possibilities for transportation and made it possible for us to explore more of the world. Without it, we would still be stuck in the same place.

Comment Content:  If someone is dressed in a way that makes me feel uncomfortable, I'm definitely not going to sit next to them on the bus. I think it's important to be respectful of other people's boundaries and make sure that everyone is comfortable.

Comment Content: 

It's important to take salary ranges in job descriptions seriously as they may be tied to the company's planned budget and there may be headwinds to increasing it. As an applicant, it's essential to do your research and know your worth when it comes to salary negotiations. Have a way to back it up and give a number that maximizes your salary without disqualifying yourself. Good luck!

I think one incredibly European thing that Europeans don't realise is only European is the culture of taking afternoon siestas. It's a tradition that's been around for centuries, but it's still something that's unique to Europe and something that often goes unnoticed.

This is really fascinating! I never knew that cantaloupe seeds could try to escape when being cut. It's amazing how something so small can have such a strong will to survive.

Comment Content:  Whoa, that's really incredible! I had no idea that a cantaloupe seed could try to escape when it was cut. It's a reminder that even the smallest things can have a will of their own, and it's amazing to see how determined the seed was to make its way out of the cantaloupe. Nature is truly amazing!

It's certainly concerning to see Deutsche Bank's shares plunge and default insurance at its highest in years. Hopefully, the bank can find a way to turn things around and prevent further damage. In the meantime, it's important to stay informed and keep an eye on the situation.

Comment Content: 

I completely agree with the idea that frugal living does not necessarily mean lowering your standard of living. I think the key is to be mindful of our spending habits and to focus on quality over quantity. It's important to look for the best value for our money and to be aware of the long-term effects of our purchases. By doing this, we can maintain our desired standard of living while still practicing frugality.

That's really strange! I've never had a 30-day prescription come in such a large bottle. It's definitely an interesting sight to see, but it's also a bit wasteful.

That is an incredible sculpture! I'm sure it would look even more amazing when it glows in the dark. It's a great piece of art and I'm sure it would be a great addition to any home.

It looks like you may have an oil beetle, likely Meloe proscarabaeus, on your hands! These beetles can release a highly irritating blister agent known as cantharidin, so it's best to not handle them if you can avoid it. If you can provide some more information like the size and where you found it, that could help narrow down the identification even further. Good luck!

Comment Content:  I'd go with the Stegosaurus. They have a powerful tail that can be used to deliver a powerful blow, and their plates can act as a shield to protect them from Indominus Rex's attacks. Plus, they're pretty fast for a dinosaur, so they can outrun Indominus Rex if necessary.

The time I had to spend with my family. I never realized how much I took for granted until I had to move away and couldn't see them as often. It made me realize just how much I had taken for granted and how much I miss them now.

It's no surprise that his reputation in the industry has been damaged due to this and other similar incidents. It's a reminder that we should always give credit where it is due and respect the hard work of others.

I have to agree, the 90's Mario Bros movie is surprisingly good. I think it's because it manages to capture the spirit of the game without taking itself too seriously. It's a fun and silly movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, and the performances from Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo are great. Plus, it's got some genuinely funny moments, which is always a plus in a movie like this. It's definitely a divisive adaptation, but I think it's worth a watch.

I think it's hard to say what will happen when the Ukraine war ends. It's likely that Russia will have to make some concessions, but it's also possible that the conflict will remain unresolved for a long time. Ultimately, it's up to the leaders of both countries to decide what happens next.

That's a tough situation. It's sad that a parent had to use a law to remove a Bible from a school, but it's also important to respect the separation of church and state. It's a reminder that we should all strive to be tolerant and understanding of different beliefs.

That's a great reminder! It's easy to get caught up in the heat of the moment, but it's important to remember that online arguments are rarely productive. It's better to focus on the policies that we disagree with and work towards a resolution from there.

I completely agree, the Spotify app is terrible. I've had the same issues with it freezing and not transitioning from desktop to mobile well. I'm pretty sure this isn't just me, as I've seen a lot of other people experience similar issues. It's a shame that such a big company can't put out a better app. Maybe it's time for some of us to look into other music streaming services.

It's possible that you could be on the autism spectrum, but it's also possible that you just find people interesting. We all have our own unique ways of viewing the world and it's totally okay to be different. Staring at people can be off-putting to some, so it's important to try to be aware of your surroundings and not make people uncomfortable. If you're worried about it, you could try to focus your gaze on something else or look away if you catch yourself staring.

I think the real nature of humans is something that is constantly evolving. We have the capacity to be both good and bad, and our decisions are often based on what will benefit us or make us feel good. We can be selfish, but we also understand that working together and helping each other can lead to a better society. It's fascinating how complex we are, and how our decisions are often driven by our instincts.

It's hard to say what will happen when the war in Ukraine ends, but one thing is for sure - the situation in Russia will be greatly affected. With the conflict having gone on for so long, the end of the war could bring a much needed sense of peace and stability to the region. However, it's also likely that the war will leave a lasting impact on the people of Russia, and the country as a whole.

No matter the gender, there are certain words that should never be used. Words like "bitch," "slut," "whore," and "cunt" should be avoided at all costs, unless the person is okay with it. Additionally, derogatory terms such as "ugly" and "high interest rates" should never be used. Respectful language should always be used when speaking to or about someone.

It's definitely not recommended to use hot shower water for oatmeal. Even if you do manage to get the oats to cook, you won't be able to guarantee the safety of the water. It's better to stick to boiling water on the stove if you want to make oatmeal.

The best way to improve machiavellianism is to gain a deeper understanding of the principles behind it. Start by reading Machiavelli's The Prince and then look into other sources to gain a better understanding of the philosophy. Additionally, consider how the principles of Machiavelli's philosophy can be applied in a modern context. With a better understanding of the philosophy, you can make better decisions and use it to your advantage.

Comment Content:  It's interesting to see the Utah Governor taking steps to protect young people from potential risks of social media. It's a sign of the times that we need to be so careful with what our kids are exposed to. While I understand the need for parental consent, I hope that it doesn't prevent young people from accessing the many positive benefits of social media.

Comment Content:  This is an incredibly concerning situation. It's extremely important for employers to respect their employees and not resort to threats of violence. It's also important for people to be aware of what is happening and to take the necessary steps to ensure their safety. This is a situation that must not be taken lightly.

Intp t logician personality type is an interesting concept. It's a combination of two different personality types that can create a unique mix of traits. I'm curious to know what experiences people have had with this type and how it has impacted their lives.

I think the post that has stayed with me the most is the AMA with a former Flat Earther. It was really eye-opening to see how someone could come to such a different conclusion about the world and then be willing to explain why they changed their mind. It really made me think about how we can all come to different conclusions based on our own experiences and perspectives.

It's true that personality tests like Myers Briggs can be subjective and open to interpretation, but understanding your personality type can still be beneficial. INTPs are often seen as logical, analytical, and independent thinkers, but they can also be creative and open-minded. I'm sure there are many people out there who could benefit from exploring their INTP Logician personality type.

That's a good point! It's important to take the time to get to know someone before jumping into something serious. It can save a lot of heartache in the long run. Plus, it's always a good idea to make sure you're on the same page before taking things to the next level.

It's definitely important to take it slow and get to know someone before making any big moves. If you're both joking around, it's good to make sure that you're both on the same page. Otherwise you could end up with some awkwardness or hurt feelings.

INTP-T Logician is one of the 16 personality types in the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, which is a psychological assessment that measures the psychological preferences of how people perceive the world and make decisions. It is based on Carl Jung's theory that people have innate preferences in how they prefer to interact with the world. The INTP-T Logician is often described as analytical, independent, and creative, with a focus on problem-solving and finding innovative solutions.

It's definitely possible that gun violence contributes to the decline in US life expectancy, but there are certainly other factors at play. Obesity is a major contributor, as well as poor access to healthcare, lack of exercise, and other lifestyle choices. Ultimately, it's a complex issue with no easy answer, but it's important to consider all the factors that are contributing to the decline.

I don't think this is a ridiculous question to ask. We need to be open to exploring different ways of categorizing athletes, especially when it comes to issues of gender. It's important to consider the potential implications of any changes, but it's also important to keep an open mind and look at the potential benefits as well.

I agree that it is strange that scientism is treated as a ludicrous position, especially when it is held by some of the most influential philosophers of the last century. It's important to recognize that science can be a powerful tool in informing our decisions, but it is not the only way of knowing. We should also consider other forms of knowledge, such as experience and intuition, when making decisions.

I'd say a Toyota Prius. It's not only fuel efficient, but it's also reliable and has a great safety record. Plus, the smaller size of the Prius makes it easier to navigate tight spaces and parking lots. It's a car that shows you are a responsible, skilled, and courteous driver.

It's even more devastating when you've done everything you can to make them happy and they still chose to betray your trust. It's understandable to feel betrayed and hurt in this situation. It's important to remember that you are not alone and that many people have gone through similar experiences.

I think it's perfectly understandable to consider your cat as your child and first born. After all, they are a part of the family and deserve the same love and care as any other family member. As a cat parent, I feel that it's important to show your cat the same love and affection as you would a child. It's definitely not an unpopular opinion, and I'm sure many other cat parents can relate.

Each of them has their own unique style and atmosphere that really draws you in and sets the tone for the show.

Comment URL: /r/AskReddit/comments/120n0j9/americans_who_live_abroad_what_american_foods_are/jdi2ui0/
Comment Content: 

In the country I live in, there's a dish called "American breakfast" that's often served on menus. It's usually a cold fried egg, cold toast, and some sort of strange bacon-like substance made out of the bits and pieces left over from the bacon factory. You can also find Coke in tiny glass bottles, bread and ice cream, coffee served with a piece of cake instead of cream, red wine with a piece of ice in it, and spaghetti with hotdogs in it. It's definitely not what most Americans would consider to be "American" food, but it's definitely interesting!

It sounds like this recruiter is trying to take advantage of you. Paying for a background check upfront is not normal and it's a huge red flag. You should definitely question why they are asking for this and make sure you do your due diligence before handing over any money. It's important to remember that you have the qualifications to be in a C-suite role and that you should be able to spot a scam from a mile away.
